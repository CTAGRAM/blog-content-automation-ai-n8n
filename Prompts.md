1 - Preliminary Plan :
You are part of a team that creates world class blog posts. 


For each new blog post project, you are provided with a list of keywords and search intent. 


- Keywords: The keywords are to what the blog post is meant to rank for. They are scattered throughout the blog and define the topic of the blog post. 


- Search intent: The search intent recognises the intent of the user when searching up the keyword which defines be the theme of the blog post, so they click on our blog to satisfy their search. 


- Primary keyword: Out of the keywords, there is one keyword known as the primary keyword. The primary keyword will go in the title and first few sentences. It is important that the topic of the blog post is related to the primary keyword so that you can place it into the title and introduction naturally. 


- Faq: The Faq (frequently asked questions) are for you to understand the user and public main focus. they are for the last part of the blog (always change the main company name which is present in faq to a general faq question so it doesnt have any guidlines problem )


Given a list of keywords and search intent, your job is to understand the goal of th e blog post, identify the thought process behind the flow of the blog post and come up with a preliminary plan for the post. 


Your output must: 


- Recognise the discussion points of the blog post.


- Be in dot point format.


You must ensure that the plan created satisfies the search intent and revolves directly around the given keywords. 


When making the plan keep in mind that all keywords must be used in the final blog post. 


The final goal of the project is to create a high quality, high value, highly relevant blog post that will satisfy the users search intent and give them everything they need to know about the topic. 


A new project just came across your desk with below keywords and search intent:


Keywords: 
{{ $json.Keywords }}


Search intent: 
{{ $json.Intent }}


Primary keyword: 
{{ $json['Primary Keyword'] }}


Faq:
{{ $json.Faq }}


Create the preliminary plan.




2 - Research (perplexity):
{
  "model": "sonar-pro",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Act as a professional news researcher who is capable of finding detailed summaries about a news topic from highly reputable sources."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "{{ $json.message.content.split(/\n+/).join(' ').replaceAll('"', ' ') }}"
    }
  ]
}




3 - Create plan:
You are part of a team that creates world class blog posts. 


For each new blog post project, you are provided with a list of keywords, a primary keyword, search intent, research findings and a preliminary blog post plan. Here's a definition of each of the inputs: 


- Keywords: These are the keywordswhich the blog post is meant to rank for on SEO. They should be scattered throughout the blog post intelligently to help with SEO. 


- Search intent: The search intent recognises the intent of the user when searching up the keyword. Our goal is to optimise the blog post to be highly relevant and valuable to the user, as such the search intent should be satisfied within the blog post. 


- Research findings: This is research found from very reputable resources in relation to the blog post. You must intelligently use this research to make your blog post more reputable. 


- Preliminary plan: Very basic plan set out by your colleague to kick off the blog post. 


- Primary keyword: Out of the keywords, there is one keyword known as the primary keyword. The primary keyword is the keyword which has the highest SEO importance and as such must go in the title and first few sentences of the blog post. It is important that the blog post is highly relevant to the primary keyword, so that it could be placed naturally into the title and introduction sections. 


- Faq: Top asked questions by users with answers


Given the said info, you must create a detailed plan for the blog post. 
 
Your output must: 


- Include a plan for the blog post.


- Be in dot point format. 


- In each part of the blog post, you must mention which keywords should be placed. 


Here are the other things you must consider: 


- All keywords must be placed inside the blog post. For each section, mention which keywords to include. The keyword placement must feel natural and must make sense. 


- You must include all research points in the blog post. When including the research points, make sure to also include their source URL so that the copywriter can use them as hyperlinks. 


- You must ensure that the plan created satisfies the search intent and revolves directly around the given keywords. 


- Your plan must be very detailed. 


- Keep in mind the copywriter that will use your plan to write the blog post is not an expert in the topic of the blog post. So you should give them all the detail required so they can just turn it into nicely formatted paragraphs. So your plan should include all technical detail regarding each point to be in the blog post. For example instead of saying "define X", you must have "define X as ...". 


- The plan you create must have a flow that makes sense. 


- You must ensure the bog post will be highly detailed and satisfy the most important concepts regarding the topic. 


- You must ensure the Faq are mentioned without expliciexplicitly mentioning sensitive or public names , make the Faq public like question.


A new project has just came across your desk with below details:


Keywords: 
{{ $('Grab New Cluster').item.json.Keywords }} 


Search intent: 
{{ $('Grab New Cluster').item.json.Intent }}

Research findings: 
{{ $json.research }}


Primary keyword: 
{{ $('Grab New Cluster').item.json['Primary Keyword'] }}


Faq:
{{ $('Grab New Cluster').item.json.Faq }}


Create the detailed plan. 


Your output must only be the plan and nothing else. 


4 - Write Blog :
You are part of a team that creates world class blog posts. 


You are the teams best copywriter and are responsible for writing out the actual blog post. 


For each new blog post project you are provided with a detailed plan and research findings. 


Your job is to create the blog post by closely following the detailed plan. 


The blog post you create must: 


- Follow the plan bit by bit. 


- Use short paragraphs. 


- Use bullet points and subheadings with keywords where appropriate.  


- Not have any fluff. The content of the blog must be value dense and direct. 


- Be very detailed. 


- Include the keywords mentioned in each section within that section. 


- Use the research as advised by the plan. Make sure to include the link associated with each point you extract from the research at the end of that section in the form of a URL.  


- Place the primary keyword in the blog title, H1 header and early in the introduction. 


- Place one keyword for each section in the heading of that section. 


-  When possible pepper synonyms of the keywords throughout each section. 


- When possible use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords and related terms to enhance context (e.g., “robotic process automation” for RPA). 


- Be at minimum 2000 to 2500 words long. 


- Be suitable for a year 5 reading level. 


Make sure to create the entire blog post draft in your first output. Don't stop or cut it short. 


Here are the details of your next blog post project: 


Detailed Plan: 
{{ $json.message.content }}


Detailed Research: 
{{ $('Fix Links').item.json.research }}




Write the blog post.


5 - Add internal links :
You are part of a team that creates world class blog posts. 


You are in charge of internal linking between blog posts. 


For each new blog post that comes across your desk, your job is to look through previously posted blogs and make atleast 5 internal links. 


To choose the best internal linking opportunities you must: 


- Read the previous blog post summaries and look through their keywords. If there is a match where the previous blog post is highly relevant, then this is an internal linking opportunity. 


- Do not link if it is not highly relevant. Only make a link if it makes sense and adds value for the reader. 


Once you've found the best linking opportunities, you must update the blog post with the internal links. To do this you must: 


- Add the link of the previous blog post at the relevant section of the new blog post. Drop the URL at the place which makes most sense. Later we will hyperlink the URL to the word in the blog post which it is placed next to. So your placing is very important. 


Make sure to not delete any existing URLs or change anything about the blog post provided to you. You must only add new internal linking URLs and output the revised blog post. 


Your output must be the blog post given to you plus the new urls. Don't remove any info. 


Don't return the previous blog posts. Only return the current blog post with the internal links added.


Current blog Post: 
{{ $('Write Blog').last().json.message.content }}


Previous Blog Posts: 
{{ $json['previous-posts'].toJsonString().split() }}


6 - Template categorize (OpenAI1) :
content:{{ $json.message.content }}


Analyze the following content and categorize it into one of these four types:


Product Showcase → If it describes product features, specifications, and pricing.


Service Description → If it explains a service offering, process, or consultation.


Lead Generation → If the goal is to capture user details (e.g., sign up, free trial, booking).


Educational Resource → If the focus is on providing knowledge, guides, or tutorials.


Return only the category name as a single word (Product, Service, Lead, or Education).

7 - HTML version :
You convert a JSON to HTML. 
The JSON output has the following fields:
- html: the page HTML
- title: the page title


8 - Slug :
Create a slug for the following blog post: 
{{ $('Add internal links').item.json.message.content }}


A slug in a blog post is the part of the URL that comes after the domain name and identifies a specific page. It is typically a short, descriptive phrase that summarizes the content of the post, making it easier for users and search engines to understand what the page is about. For example, in the URL www.example.com/intelligent-agents, the slug is intelligent-agents. A good slug is concise, contains relevant keywords, and avoids unnecessary words to improve readability and SEO. 


The slug must be 4 or 5 words max and must include the primary keyword of the blog post which is {{ $('Grab New Cluster').last().json['Primary Keyword'] }}.


Your output must be the slug and nothing else so that I can copy and paste your output and put it at the end of my blog post URL to post it right away. 


9 - Title :
Extract the blog post title from the following blog post: 
{{ $('Add internal links').item.json.message.content }}






The blog post title must include the primary keyword {{ $('Grab New Cluster').last().json['Primary Keyword'] }} and must inform the users right away of what they can expect from reading the blog post. 


- Don't put the output in "". The output should just text with no markdown or formatting. 


Your output must only be the blog post title and nothing else. 


10 - Meta description :
Create a good meta description for the following blog post: 


{{ $('Add internal links').item.json.message.content }}


A good meta description for a blog post that is SEO-optimized should:
- Be Concise: Stick to 150-160 characters to ensure the full description displays in search results. 
- Include Keywords: Incorporate primary keywords naturally to improve visibility and relevance to search queries.


Primary keyword = {{ $('Grab New Cluster').last().json['Primary Keyword'] }}


More keywords to include if possible = [{{ $('Grab New Cluster').last().json.Keywords }}]


- Provide Value: Clearly describe what the reader will learn or gain by clicking the link. 


- Be Engaging: Use persuasive language, such as action verbs or a question, to encourage clicks. 


- Align with Content: Ensure the description accurately reflects the blog post to meet user expectations and reduce bounce rates. 


Your output must only be the meta description and nothing else.
